# Project 6 - Visualizing Real World Data

Project by Shelley Obery, Nicholas *get last name* and Jo√£o Fernandes

## Project Description

## Sourcing the data

#### Covid-19 epidemiological data

We retrieved data regarding the number of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries for each US state from Datahub ([here](https://datahub.io/core/covid-19#resource-covid-19_zip)). This data covered the time period between 2020-01-22 and 2020-07-04. It was available as a csv file, which can be found in the raw_data folder.

#### Covid-19 policy data

Data regarding the different policies enacted in each US state, including the days when they were enacted, was retrieved from Github ([here](https://github.com/COVID19StatePolicy/SocialDistancing/blob/master/data/USstatesCov19distancingpolicy.csv)). It was available as a csv file, which can be found in the raw_data folder.

#### US political data

For data regarding the political landscape of each state in the US, we scraped [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party_strength_in_U.S._states) wikipedia page, which contained a table with all the information we needed. The code is available in notebook _number of notebook_ and the resulting table was stored as a csv file in the data folder.

#### US population data

State population and population density was obtained from [here] (https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/state-densities) as a csv file and can be found in the raw_data folder
